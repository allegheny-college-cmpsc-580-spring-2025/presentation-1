![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d6a1cfbf-9e61-4e96-885b-e895076fa83d)

## Important information

* Presentation date: `17 February`

## Guidelines

Having completed at least one or two full attempts at the experiment from your original Disciplinary Research
paper, this presentation should achieve a few things:

1. Present results from the experiment in visual form
2. Cite evidence from at least two (2) of the three (3) papers in your current research portfolio which:
  - support, explain, or contradict your results
  - suggest a new (novel) experiment to complete
  - allow you to draw a conclusion about what these results _mean_
3. Detail/outline your plans for your novel experiment
  - what question(s) does the experiment propose or answer?
  - what software or hardware does this experiment require?
  - what do you understand the steps necessary to reproduce it to be?
  - what kind of deliverable(s) are you expecting (e.g. charts, tables, graphs)?
  - what kind of outcome(s) are you expecting (e.g. the same as or different to the original results)?

## Slides

This presentation should involve a short slide deck (between `5`-`7` slides) which include:

* an outline of the experiment you're attempted
* the question(s) that this experiment proposes or answers
* generated deliverables from running the experiment
* citations for the evidence used

## Presentation log

See course [evaluation and deliverable guidelines for these posts](https://github.com/allegheny-college-cmpsc-580-spring-2025/course-materials/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md#presentation-log) for more information vis-a-vis requirements.

This post should include:

* an assessment of the level of success achieved through this experiment
* a short outline of the experiment you plan to pursue as your novel experiment
* assumptions, software, or, hardware that the new experiment requires
* your plan for completing this experiment successfuly by `28 February`

To be clear with your responses to each of the areas above, the instructor encourages you to use [Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/markdown-cheatsheet) headings to create sections.
Each student is also required to upload their own copy of the presentation to their `Presentation Log`, linking it in the post. See the
sample post included in your `Project Portfolio` for details.
