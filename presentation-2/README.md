## Important information

* Presentation date: `3 February`

## Guidelines

Your goal in this presentation is to tackle the following key areas:



Keep in mind that these presentations are no more than `5` minutes. This particular presentation _will not_ have a `Q & A`. Evaluation will
be done by members of the class immediately proceeding the completion of the presentation.

### Slides

For this presentation, you must create slides that aim to synthesize your independent findings. You may use any of your
work from your FigJam whiteboards, including a tool that _might_ help create slides. When in your FigJam whiteboard:

- locate the `Figma` menu in the upper left corner and select `File`
- from the resulting subment, select the option labeled `Create Figma Slides outline`

![Creating a Figma Slides outline](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/db1f1f8b-651a-408e-8eab-d4622944d1ad)

Using this tool will allow you to create a _template_ of a possible presentation based on the contents of the FigJam board. (This implies
that the more content you have, the more detailed your outline will be!) While the template may not copy images from your
whiteboard, you are able to copy and paste them into the presentation.

## Presentation log

While the presentation will be done jointly, each student in the presenting team will need to complete their own `Presentation Log` post
using their `Project Portfolio`. (See course [evaluation and deliverable guidelines for these posts](https://github.com/allegheny-college-cmpsc-580-spring-2025/course-materials/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md#presentation-log) for more information vis-a-vis requirements.)

This post asks you to consider:



To be clear with your responses to each of the areas above, the instructor encourages you to use [Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/markdown-cheatsheet) headings to create sections.
Each student is also required to upload their own copy of the presentation to their `Presentation Log`, linking it in the post. See the
sample post included in your `Project Portfolio` for details.
