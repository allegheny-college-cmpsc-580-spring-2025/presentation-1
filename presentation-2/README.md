## Important information

* Presentation date: `3 February`

## Guidelines

Keshav's "How to Read a Paper" defines the "Second Pass" reading as one in which you:

> read the paper with greater care, but ignore details such as proofs. It helps to
> jot down the key points, or to make comments in the margins, as you read.

Your job in this presentation is, essentially, to show off your engagement with the text -- to model, for your peers, how you might
annotate a source while reading it. You're going to talk through your process of engaging _deeply_ with the article you've been
assigned.

Keep in mind that this presentation should only take `5` minutes, and consider it a show-and-tell more than a true presentation.
Some of the ideas below suggest ways that you can demonstrate your understanding (only use those that actually _help_ you). You must also:

* describe what the "big idea" (claim) behind the paper is with:
  * 3 main areas of supporting reasoning/evidence
  * a single reasoning statement that connects the reasoning to the "big idea" claim

Here some areas that you might consider in order to help you engage with the text; keep in mind that your annotations should
help a reader understand how you came up with your "big idea" and accompanying reasoning.

### Highlighting

* Use different colors for different parts of the paper (i.e. main ideas, technologies)
* It may help to develop a clear color code. One suggestion:
    * Green for a main ideas
    * Yellow for supporting evidence
    * Blue for key terminology or technology
    * Red/Orange for ideas that are still confusing or difficult

### Writing in the margins

* Summarize or write brief statements condensing paragraphs or given sections
* Draw arrows between similar ideas and annotate how the ideas connected are related
* Develop a system of symbols that allow you to see patterns or repetition of ideas throughout the paper

## Slides

This presentation doesn't involve slides, but will involve paper copies of an example of a page with detailed annotation. Bring the page
that you'd like to use to the instructor before class so that they can make color copies of your annotations (please no photos of pages,
provide the instructor with the _actual page_; they'll make photocopies).

## Presentation log

While the presentation will be done jointly, each student in the presenting team will need to complete their own `Presentation Log` post
using their `Project Portfolio`. (See course [evaluation and deliverable guidelines for these posts](https://github.com/allegheny-college-cmpsc-580-spring-2025/course-materials/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md#presentation-log) for more information vis-a-vis requirements.)

This post should include:

* your "big idea" statement
  * 3 (minimum) pieces of evidence from the paper
  * the reasoning statement tying all of the evidence to the "big idea" (claim)
* a scan of the page that you plan to share with the class (the instructor can help you with this)
* the strategies that worked _best_ for you (and why)
* the strategies that worked _worst_ for you (and why)

To be clear with your responses to each of the areas above, the instructor encourages you to use [Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/markdown-cheatsheet) headings to create sections.
Each student is also required to upload their own copy of the presentation to their `Presentation Log`, linking it in the post. See the
sample post included in your `Project Portfolio` for details.
