## Important information

* Presentation date: `10 February`

## Guidelines

## Slides

This presentation should involve a short slide deck (between `5`-`7` slides) which details:

* an outline of the experiment you're attempting
* the question(s) that this experiment proposes or answers
* the "setup" of the experiment:
  * what software or hardware does this experiment require?
  * what do you understand the steps necessary to reproduce it to be?
  * what kind of deliverable(s) are you expecting (e.g. charts, tables, graphs)?
  * what kind of outcome(s) are you expecting (e.g. the same as or different to the original results)?
* if you've already run any preliminary attempts:
  * show generated deliverable(s)
  * describe steps you've taken/software you've altered, created, or used
  * methods you've employed
* a description your progress _and_ how you will know you've completed/reproduced the experiment

## Presentation log

See course [evaluation and deliverable guidelines for these posts](https://github.com/allegheny-college-cmpsc-580-spring-2025/course-materials/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md#presentation-log) for more information vis-a-vis requirements.
This post also presumes that you've at least attempted some shallow form of the experiment by the time the post is due (i.e. Monday).

This post should include:

* the question(s) you believe the experiment proposes or answers
* an example of the deliverable(s):
  * you expect to generate
  * _have_ generated to this point (even if incomplete)
* a description of how far you believe you are from completing the experiment _and_ how you will know you've completed/reproduced it
* a reflection on the process of completing this experiment, including technical difficulties or questions arising in the process

To be clear with your responses to each of the areas above, the instructor encourages you to use [Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/markdown-cheatsheet) headings to create sections.
Each student is also required to upload their own copy of the presentation to their `Presentation Log`, linking it in the post. See the
sample post included in your `Project Portfolio` for details.
