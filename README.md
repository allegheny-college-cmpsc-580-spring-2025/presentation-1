## Important information

* Presentation date: `27 January 2025`

## Guidelines

Your goal in this presentation is tackle three key areas:

- A definition of the experiment as `reproducible`, `repeatable`, or `replicable`, accompanied by reasons why
- An assessment of this experiment as _research_, which may include (but is not limited to):
  - If the experiment leads to new, generalizable outcomes
  - If the experiment uncovers new areas of further exploration, even if it doesn't (itself) come to a conclusion
  - If the experiment features a research question motivated by a need to respond to questions beyond "yes" or "no" answers
- A speculation as to the _disciplinary significance_ (that is, how your approach to this question reflects your academic training to this point)

You will also be _grouped_ into pairs for this exercise, to be announced in our course's Discord server.

Keep in mind that these presentations are no more than `5` minutes. This particular presentation _will not_ have a `Q & A`. Evaluation will
be done by members of the class immediately proceeding the completion of the presentation.

### Slides

For this presentation, you must create slides that aim to synthesize your independent findings. You may use any of your
work from your FigJam whiteboards, including a tool that _might_ help create slides. When in your FigJam whiteboard:

- locate the `Figma` menu in the upper left corner and select `File`
- from the resulting subment, select the option labeled `Create Figma Slides outline`

![Creating a Figma Slides outline](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/db1f1f8b-651a-408e-8eab-d4622944d1ad)

Using this tool will allow you to create a _template_ of a possible presentation based on the contents of the FigJam board. (This implies
that the more content you have, the more detailed your outline will be!) While the template may not copy images from your
whiteboard, you are able to copy and paste them into the presentation.

## Presentation log

While the presentation will be done jointly, each student in the presenting team will need to complete their own `Presentation Log` post
using their `Project Portfolio`. (See course [evaluation and deliverable guidelines for these posts](https://github.com/allegheny-college-cmpsc-580-spring-2025/course-materials/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md#presentation-log) for more information vis-a-vis requirements.)

This posts asks you to consider:
* the reason(s) why you felt your inquiry was specific to your academic training (i.e. major)
* the relative success of your attempt at visualizing the experiment, and:
  * where the visualization succeeds in confirming those reasons
  * where there's room to improve the visualization
* a statement of your final research question underpinning the experiment, and
* a list of sources or areas of inquiry that you would pursue to deepen your engagement with this question as research

To be clear with your responses to each of the areas above, the instructor encourages you to use [Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/markdown-cheatsheet) headings to create sections.
Each student is also required to upload their own copy of the presentation to their `Presentation Log`, linking it in the post. See the
sample post included in your `Project Portfolio` for details.
