## Important information

* Presentation date: `27 January 2025`

## Guidelines

Your goal in this presentation is tackle three key areas:

- A definition of the experiment as `reproducible`, `repeatable`, or `replicable`, accompanied by reasons why
- An assessment of this experiment as _research_, which may include (but is not limited to):
  - If the experiment leads to new, generalizable outcomes
  - If the experiment uncovers new areas of further exploration, even if it doesn't (itself) come to a conclusion
  - If the experiment features a research question motivated by a need to respond to questions beyond "yes" or "no" answers
- A speculation as to the _disciplinary significance_ (that is, how your approach to this question reflects your academic training to this point)

You will also be _grouped_ into pairs for this exercise, to be announced in our course's Discord server.

### Slides

For this presentation, you must create slides that aim to synthesize your independent findings. You may use any of your
work from your FigJam whiteboards, including a tool that _might_ help create slides. When in your FigJam whiteboard:

- locate the `Figma` menu in the upper left corner and select `File`
- from the resulting subment, select the option labeled `Create Figma Slides outline`
