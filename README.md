## Important information

## Guidelines

Your goal in this presentation is tackle three key areas:

- A definition of the experiment as `reproducible`, `repeatable`, or `replicable`, accompanied by reasons why
- An assessment of this experiment as _research_, which may include (but is not limited to):
  - If the experiment leads to new, generalizable outcomes
  - If the experiment uncovers new areas of further exploration, even if it doesn't (itself) come to a conclusion
  - If the experiment features a research question motivated by a need to respond to questions beyond "yes" or "no" answers
- A speculation as to the _disciplinary significance_ (that is, how your approach to this question reflects your academic training to this point)
